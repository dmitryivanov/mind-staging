RDS Migrations & Schema management
-----------------------------------

In db/rds_migrate we have migrations that run only for RDS db, via RdsMigration class,
which is defined in lib/rds.rb. It basically establishes connection with RDS instead of
database defined in database.yml. 

Tasks for managing RDS db are:
rake rds:db:migrate
rake rds:db:rollback
rake rds:schema:load
rake rds:schema:dump

Also, there are rake tasks to create secondary test database:
rake rds:test:create
rake rds:test:migrate

RDS settings are autoloaded from .env and .env.test files via dotenv gem in development
and test environments.

Implemented as a workaround for heroku wich do not allow working with two databases via database.yml.




# Q: What members info should be loaded to mailchimp as merge fields and what will be their name?
#    For now I load only emails and first/last name

# Q: Do we have to update local customers in mailchimp? E.g. when user email or name changes in our db

# Q: people are marked as cleaned even if they cleaned or unsubscribed only on one list
#   we can use a mc_list reference to tie changes to list

# Note: mailchimp list and campaigns are global for app, not bound to user,
# so is for last updated timestamps wich are used to calculate delta

# Note: will have lots of customers that do not have an email.
#       and there are cases where an email could appear twice.

# Q: if customer or warranty is found, should it be updated with new info?

# Note: Right now when we load customer_warranties dataload, we don't have field
#       to indicate email_permission_ind

# if customer is in db he is not updated,
# and if cleared/unsubscribed customer in not in db,
# he is not created

# also, cleared/unsubscribed state is per-customer and
# not per-list, so if customer is unsubscribed from any
# list, he will be marked as unsubscribed in our db
